        Combined Heat and Power (CHP), also known as cogeneration, is a highly efficient method of generating electricity and thermal energy from the same energy source. Basically, it's producing two types of energy in one go. What makes it cool is that it's a type of distributed generation, which means it generates power right where it's needed, rather than at a large plant somewhere else.

        Cogeneration captures the heat that would typically be wasted in power generation, instead using it for heating and cooling. Thus, it is highly efficient and versatile. It can use a variety of fuels, including both fossil and renewable ones. For decades, CHP has powered of large industrial, commercial, and institutional settings, as well as utility circles.
        
        CHP systems can achieve efficiencies of 65-75%, a substantial improvement over the national average of about 50% when these services are provided separately.

           #### Limitations
            Buildings were filtered to only include those in Philadelphia County and within 1000m of the steam loop. The counts are estimated (see Disclaimer). It is unknown to what extent buildings may draw from the steam loop (perhaps more or less than the chosen distance).</b>According to a 2020 Inquirer article, "The Center City district heating system produces steam at a central power plant and delivers it by underground pipes to about 500 buildings."
            So we can assume that there are at least 500 buildings connected to the steam loop.
            Whether additional buildings are connected, or could be connected in the future, is unknown.
